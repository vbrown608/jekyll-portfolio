At work I'm a web developer at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][eff]. I work across the stack in JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP. I use [Docker] to get our apps ready for development and production. I love working closely with other teams to plan and execute projects.

Before joining EFF I was part of a consensus-based worker cooperative, mapped Oakland campaign finance in [D3], and applied machine learning techniques to birdsong and text simplification.

Outside of software I like cooking, dancing, riding my bike, and reading. I also like learning about new ways to get involved with the movements I care about, like prison abolition and climate justice. In my free time, I like sharing meals and catching up with my roommates and close friends.

My favorite fictional characters are Willow Rosenberg from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and T-Rex from [Dinosaur Comics]
