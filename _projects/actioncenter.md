EFF's Action Center Platform allows administrators to create, track, and manage online organizing campaigns. EFF's supporters participate in campaigns by taking actions like

- signing a petition
- submitting comments via our [Phantom of the Capitol](https://github.com/EFForg/phantom-of-the-capitol) API
- connecting to Congress through Twilio with our [Call Congress](https://github.com/EFForg/call-congress) tool
- posting on Twitter

Users can track their actions and manage the data EFF stores. The platform is built in __Rails__ and a little bit of React. It's available as an open source tool for other organizations to use.

My responsibilities include adding new __backend__ and __frontend__ functionality, maintaing the application, and using __Docker__ and Docker Compose to facilitate development and deploys.
