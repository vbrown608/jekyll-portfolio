At work I'm an Engineering Team Lead at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org). I do full-stack web development and devops. I especially like backend work. My best languages are Go and Ruby. I manage two direct reports and enjoy working closely with other teams to plan and execute projects.

Before joining EFF I was part of a consensus-based worker cooperative, mapped Oakland campaign finance in D3, and applied machine learning techniques to birdsong and text simplification.

In 2017 I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I wrote a [kernel](/projects/yehos.html) in C, implemented the [Forth](https://github.com/domspad/yehos/blob/master/apps/forth.asm) programming language in assembly, completed the [Stripe CTF](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag), and more.

These days I'm working on [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) in Go and learning more about hardware and microcontrollers. For coding I like Ubuntu, i3, and Vim.

Outside of software I like cooking, dancing, riding my bike, and reading. I also like learning about new ways to get involved with the movements I care about. At home I like sharing meals and catching up with my roommates and close friends.
