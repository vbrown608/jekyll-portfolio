I'm a software engineer based in the Bay Area. I recently left my job as engineering team lead at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org) and am travelling, working on projects, and looking for my next role.

Before joining EFF I was part of a consensus-based worker cooperative, mapped Oakland campaign finance in D3, and applied machine learning techniques to birdsong and text simplification.

In 2017 I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I wrote a [kernel](/projects/yehos.html) in C, implemented the [Forth](https://github.com/domspad/yehos/blob/master/apps/forth.asm) programming language in assembly, completed the [Stripe CTF](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag), and more.

These days I'm studying distributed systems (I recently completed labs for [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)), working on [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) in Go, learning more about hardware and microcontrollers, and reading *Designing Data Intensive Systems*. For coding I like Ubuntu, i3, and Vim.

Outside of software I like cooking, dancing, riding my bike, and reading. I also like learning about new ways to get involved with the movements I care about. At home I like sharing meals and catching up with my roommates and close friends.
