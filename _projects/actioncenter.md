EFF's Action Center Platform allows administrators to create, track, and manage online organizing campaigns. EFF's supporters participate in campaigns by taking actions like

- signing a petition
- submitting comments via our [Congress Forms](https://github.com/EFForg/congress_forms) API
- connecting to Congress through Twilio with our [Call Congress](https://github.com/EFForg/call-congress) tool
- posting on Twitter

Users can track their actions and manage the data EFF stores. The platform is built in Rails and a little bit of React. It's available as an open source tool for other organizations to use.

My responsibilities include adding new backend and frontend functionality, maintaing the application, and using Docker and Docker Compose to facilitate development and deploys.
